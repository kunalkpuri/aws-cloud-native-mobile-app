- **Cost Controls**: The app incorporates cost-effective AWS services, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon S3, as well as cost management tools like AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets, which allow you to optimize costs by monitoring and managing your AWS spending, setting budget thresholds, and receiving cost alerts.


## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with the Cloud Native Mobile App:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Git**: Install Git by following the instructions on the official Git website.
- **Gradle**: Install Gradle by following the instructions on the official Gradle website.
- **Android Studio**: Install Android Studio for Android development from the official Android Developer website.
- **Xcode**: Install Xcode for iOS development from the official Apple Developer website.
- **AWS Account**: Sign up for an AWS Account at https://aws.amazon.com/ and make sure you have the necessary access and credentials.

### Setting Up AWS Credentials

To interact with AWS services, you need to set up your AWS credentials. Follow the steps below to configure your credentials:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.
2. Create a new IAM user with programmatic access and attach the necessary permissions.
3. Obtain the access key ID and secret access key for the IAM user.

Next, you need to configure the AWS CLI with your credentials. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
aws configure
```

Provide your access key ID, secret access key, AWS region, and default output format when prompted.

### Setting Up the Backend
To set up the backend services of the Cloud Native Mobile App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-native-mobile-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd cloud-native-mobile-app/backend
   ```

3. Initialize the Terraform project by running:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
   
4. Configure the backend infrastructure by setting appropriate values in the variables.tf file.

- Replace the <your-aws-region> placeholder with your desired AWS region.
- Update other variables as needed, such as bucket names, table names, etc.

5. Apply the Terraform configuration to create the backend infrastructure:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
  
Review the planned changes and confirm the execution by typing *`yes`* when prompted.

6. Once the infrastructure is provisioned, note down the output values displayed by Terraform. These include endpoint URLs, bucket names, or other configuration details that you will need in the subsequent steps.

### Setting Up the Frontend

To set up the frontend of the Cloud Native Mobile App, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
  
2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
  
3. Update the configuration file with the backend endpoint URL and other necessary details.

- Open the src/config.js file.
- Replace the placeholder <backend-endpoint-url> with the actual endpoint URL obtained from the previous step.

4. Build the frontend code:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
  
5. Deploy the frontend to AWS S3:

   ```bash
   aws s3 sync build/ s3://<your-s3-bucket-name>
   ```
  
   Replace *`<your-s3-bucket-name>`* with the name of the S3 bucket you created during the backend setup.

6. Once the deployment is complete, you can access the deployed frontend by visiting the configured domain or the S3 bucket URL.

## Deployment

To deploy the Cloud Native Mobile App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Git repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-native-mobile-app.git
   ```
  
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cloud-native-mobile-app
   ```
  
3. Set up your AWS credentials by configuring the AWS CLI. Ensure you have the necessary access and credentials to deploy AWS resources.

4. Update the necessary configurations in the deployment script (`deploy.sh`) according to your requirements. Replace the placeholder values with your desired settings.

5. Run the deployment script to package and deploy the app's backend services:

   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```
  
   The script will utilize CloudFormation to create the required resources, such as AWS Lambda functions, API Gateway endpoints, and DynamoDB tables.

6. After the deployment is complete, take note of the output information provided by the script, such as API endpoint URLs, AWS service names, etc. These details will be needed for testing and interacting with the deployed app.
  
## CI/CD Pipeline

  The Cloud Native Mobile App uses a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process. The pipeline is configured using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and other related services.

To set up the CI/CD pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the pipeline directory:

   ```bash
   cd pipeline
   ```
  
2. Open the `pipeline.yaml` file and update the configuration as needed. Ensure that the source, build, and deploy stages are configured correctly based on your environment.

3. Deploy the pipeline using the AWS CloudFormation stack:

   ```bash
   aws cloudformation deploy --template-file pipeline.yaml --stack-name cloud-native-mobile-app-pipeline --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
   ```
  
   The deployment will create the necessary pipeline resources, such as CodePipeline, CodeBuild projects, and IAM roles.

4. Once the deployment is complete, the pipeline will be triggered automatically whenever changes are pushed to the configured source repository. The pipeline will build, test, and deploy the app automatically based on the defined stages.
  
## IaC Pipeline

The Cloud Native Mobile App also includes an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) pipeline to automate the provisioning and management of the backend infrastructure using Terraform.

To set up the IaC pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `iac-pipeline` directory:

   ```bash
   cd iac-pipeline
   ```
  
2. Open the `pipeline.yaml` file and update the configuration as needed. Ensure that the source and deploy stages are configured correctly based on your environment.

3. Deploy the pipeline using the AWS CloudFormation stack:

   ```bash
   aws cloudformation deploy --template-file pipeline.yaml --stack-name cloud-native-mobile-app-iac-pipeline --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
   ```
  
   The deployment will create the necessary pipeline resources, such as CodePipeline, CodeBuild projects, and IAM roles.

4. Once the deployment is complete, the pipeline will be triggered automatically whenever changes are made to the infrastructure code. The pipeline will provision and manage the backend infrastructure automatically based on the defined stages.
